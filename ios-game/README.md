# 🐈‍⬛ Charcoal the Bombay

**Charcoal the Bombay** is a mobile-first 2D side-scrolling platformer inspired by classic **Game Boy Advance–era games**, built as a modern iOS prototype using AI-assisted development.

The project stars **Charcoal**, a Bombay cat, navigating colourful environments, avoiding enemies, and collecting treats in a cozy, nostalgic platforming experience.

## 🎮 Purpose of the Game

The game is designed to:
- Recreate the **tight, simple fun** of classic handheld platformers
- Deliver a **low-friction, joyful experience** optimised for mobile touch controls
- Explore how far **AI-assisted tooling** can go in rapidly scaffolding a playable game MVP

Gameplay focuses on:
- Side-scrolling platform mechanics (run, jump, double-jump)
- Enemies such as mice and birds
- Power-ups like cat treats and scratch pads
- Colourful, friendly environments (trees, playgrounds, indoor cat spaces)

The tone is intentionally **cozy, playful, and accessible**, rather than competitive or complex.

## 🧪 Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists as:
- A **working prototype** of a mobile game
- A **learning and experimentation space** for AI-assisted game development
- A reference for **structured, phase-based prompting** to build software with AI tools

It is not intended to be a finished commercial game (yet), but rather a:
- Playable MVP
- Foundation for future expansion
- Case study in modern, prompt-driven development workflows

## 🛠 Tools & Technology

### Game Development
- **iOS mobile platform**
- 2D side-scrolling architecture
- Touch-first controls
- Lightweight, performance-focused structure

### AI Tooling
- **Rork.ai** — used as the AI development environment to scaffold, run, and iterate on the mobile game prototype using structured, phase-based prompts.

**Primary model used:**
- **GPT-5.2** — for:
  - Game architecture
  - Core mechanics
  - Code scaffolding
  - Iterative feature expansion

GPT-5.2 was chosen for its strength in:
- End-to-end product thinking
- Structured code generation
- Managing complex constraints across multiple development phases

Additional models may be used selectively for:
- Visual style descriptions
- Narrative tone
- Asset concepts

## 🧩 Development Approach

The project follows a **phase-based build strategy**:
1. Minimal playable scaffold
2. Core gameplay mechanics
3. Level design and environment depth
4. Visual identity and animation
5. Optional audio and polish

This approach prioritises:
- Fast feedback loops
- Stability over scope
- Clean iteration without regeneration overhead

---

## 🚀 Status

- Current state: **Playable prototype / MVP**
- Scope: **Single-level platformer**
- Future potential:
  - Additional levels
  - Expanded abilities
  - Polished assets
  - App Store release
